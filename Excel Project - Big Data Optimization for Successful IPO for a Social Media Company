The objective of this project is multifaceted. First, I  conducted a thorough audit of the client's current big data practices. This included analyzing their data sets to identify trends and opportunities for improvement. I merged and cleaned their data tables, conducted in-depth analysis of content categories, and created clear visualizations to facilitate understanding.														
Secondly,prepare the  client for a successful Initial Public Offering (IPO). This involves not only ensuring that their data practices are robust and compliant but also providing expertise in managing their rapid growth and scalability challenges.														
Each tab in this report contains visual analyses based on the provided content and answers to questions, facilitating data-driven decision-making.
